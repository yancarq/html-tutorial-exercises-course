		<h1>This will be your heading</h1>
		<p>Then, you star talking about some interesting stuff that nobody wants to read</p>
		<p>Then you can quote someone to add credibility:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>A quotation is a handy thing to have about, saving one the trouble of thinking for oneself, always a laborious business</p>
			<p><strong>- A.A. Milne, If I May</strong></p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Finally you can have some bullets to summarize everything, after all, new generations have this things in common:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't like to read long texts.</li>
			<li>Have the spawn of attention of a bird.</li>
			<li>Skip long paragraphs straight to the bullet points.</li>
		</ul>
	</body>
